Hi there! My name is Taylor (she/her). I am from Highlands Ranch, Colorado and currently am finishing up my last semester at the
University of Colorado, Boulder. I am graduating with a BS in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing from the
Leeds School of Business.I also have a minor in Creative Technology Design from the College of Engineering and Science. 
On the weekends, I like to spend time outdoors with friends, try new foods, and journal. I love to travel and have been to eleven
different countries, my top favorites being Vietnam and Germany. I have had several marketing internships from agency work to consulting,
and have recently accepted a full-time position at RSM's Denver Tech Center Office following graduation. In this position, I will be working on the consulting side of the company
on the product strategy team as an Industry Go-To-Market Coordinator. If you are interesting in hiring me or working with me, please check out my CONTACT ME page.
I look forward to hearing from you!
