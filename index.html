Hi there! My name is Taylor (she/her). I am from Highlands Ranch, Colorado and currently am finishing up my last semester at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am graduating with a BS in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing from the Leeds School of Business. I also have a minor in Creative
Technology Design from the College of Engineering and Science. On the weekends, I like to spend time
outdoors with friends, try new foods, and journal. I love to travel and have been to eleven different countries, my top
favorites being Vietnam and Germany. I have had several marketing internships from agency work to
consulting, and have recently accepted a full-time position at RSM's Denver Tech Center Office. My new role at RSM will be on the consulting
side of the business, working as a Go-To-Market Coordinator on the Product Strategy team! I am so excited for this new chapter.
If you are interesting in hiring me or working with me, please check out my CONTACT ME page. I look forward to hearing from you!
