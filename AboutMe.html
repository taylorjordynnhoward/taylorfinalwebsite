              Hi there! My name is Taylor and I am so excited to have you on my page! Currently,
              I am in limbo between graduating college at CU Boulder and starting a new full-time position
              at RSM later this summer. My goals for this summer are to travel, spend some quality time
              with the friends I've made in Boulder, and spend as much time outside as possible!
              I'm so excited to spend time hiking, camping, and hopefully at the beach! I love to meet
              other artists/creators and collaborate, so feel free to reach out to me on my CONTACT ME page!
              I look forward to hearing from you!
